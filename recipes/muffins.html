    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Healthy Blueberry Muffins – made with nutritious whole wheat flour, nutty almond flour, plenty of fresh blueberries, and sweetened with real maple syrup instead of sugar. It’s a healthier version that’s still perfectly delicious!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (150g) whole wheat flour (scoop and level to measure)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (56g) almond flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (72g) unbleached all-purpose flour (scoop and level to measure)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (155ml) buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) real maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (80ml) olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (220g) fresh blueberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</li>
        <li>Whisk dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl whisk together wheat flour, almond flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Make a well in the center of the mixture.</li>
        <li>Mix wet ingredients: In a separate medium mixing bowl whisk together buttermilk, maple syrup, eggs, olive oil and vanilla until well blended.</li>
        <li>Combine mixtures: Pour buttermilk mixture into flour mixture. Fold with a rubber spatula until just nearly combined, then add blueberries and fold just until combined.</li>
        <li>Divide batter among muffin cups: Spray a 12-cup muffin pan with non-stick cooking spray. Pour batter into muffin cups filling each nearly to the top (I like to use a large ice cream scoop to scoop batter).</li>
        <li>Bake until cooked through: Bake in preheated oven until toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 16 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool in pan several minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Store in an airtight container, for longer shelf life they can be frozen up to 3 months.</li>
    </ol>
